- REST is flexible and robust
- REST takes least bandwidth among other APIs
- This makes REST faster

# What next?

- Car data is used by default in data.json file
- Implement resources according to need of your application
- Integerate API with your application

- Search Data : Send GET request with id

- Update Data : Send PUT request with id and body(in JSON)

- Delete Data : Send DELETE request with id

# Take it to next level

- Integrate applications and it is all yours

- Modify datasets according to your need
